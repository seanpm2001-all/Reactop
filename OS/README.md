# README - For the OS directory

The OS directory contains the files that come with the Reactop laptop.

I originally planned for the Reactop laptop to either come with only ReactOS on it, or for it to be dual booted with ReactOS and an old version of Windows (Windows 7 and below) if I were to get permission from Microsoft. I doubt that at this point.

This directory contains other files as well, but does not contain ReactOS or Microsoft Windows system files.

The `OS/`directory should be skipped, unless you want to include the `README.md` file that you are currently reading.

The `OS/ReactOS/Documentation/Wikipedia/July17th2020/PDF/` directory contains a PDF of the ReactOS Wikipedia page from July 17th 2020

The `OS/ReactOS/SampleImages/` directory contains public domain, sample images of ReactOS, for use of display and demonstration of what ReactOS is like.

Finally (for now) The `OS/ReactOS/SampleVideos/` directory contains public domain, sample videos of ReactOS. Currently, the only video is of ReactOS being able to print to a printer.

That is all the info for this directory.
